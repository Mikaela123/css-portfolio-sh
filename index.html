        <h2> Who am I?</h2>
        <p> Hello, my name is Mikaela and I am currently a freshman at Summit<br>
        Shasta in Daly City, California. I have a mom, dad, and a younger<br>
        brother in 5th grade. I have been many places in the world with them, 
        but<br> my favorite place was Hawaii! I love Hawaii because of their nice, 
        warm<br> weather and beautiful beaches.</p>
      
        <h2> What do I like?</h2>
        <p> I love to watch comedy movies, one of my favorite ones are Blended,<br> 
        starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore. I love food as well as<br> movies, 
        my favorite type of food is Japanese, especially dragon roll. To<br> even 
        out all the eating of Japanese food I enjoy to play basketball and<br> 
        volleyball. My favorite part of sports is when you learn to believe in<br> 
        yourself and learn new things!</p>
